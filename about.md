I'm a Ph.D. student majoring in economics at Pennsylvania State University, but recently I'm very interested in reinforcement learning especiall multi-agent RL and this blog is used to record my learning notes. If you have questions or want to communicate with me, welcome to [email](wzz10@psu.edu) me.
