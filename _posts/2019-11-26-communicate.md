> The reasons why animals, especially human beings, communicate are variant. According to my knowledge of economics and game theory, I give two reasons with some simple and pedagogical examples. Firstly, when cooperation is beneficial, agents use communication to coordinate their behaviors. Secondly, when the information about the environment or state is incomplete and different agents have different information, they communicate to exchange informations to get a better knowledge of the world.




# Preliminary
The following analysis and examples all depend on the framework of game theory. When analyzing a game, we usually don't care about communication and hence the definiton of **Nash Equilibrium** is widely used. 

In principle, we argued, anything that a player can do to communicate and coordinate with other players could be described by moves in an extensive-form game, so planning these communication moves would become part of his strategy choice itself. 
Although this perspective can be fully general in principle, it is not necessarily the most fruitful way to think about all games

it might be more useful to leave communication and coordination possibilities out of our explicit game model. If we do so, then we must instead use solution concepts that express an assumption that players have implicit communication opportunities, in addition to the strategic options explicitly described in the game model.


A Nobel-prize-winning game theorist, R. Myerson, has gone so far as to say that “if there is intelligent life on other planets, in a majority of them, they would have discovered correlated equilibrium before Nash equilibrium.”

## Cooperation and Competition
In general, games can be classified into three categories according to agents's disire of cooperation and competition:

* **Pure Cooperative Games**, which is also called the **Constant-sum games**. Since a positive affine transmation doesn't change the agents' preference, this is also called **zero-sum games**. In such games, for each outcome, the summation of all agent's utility is zero. Refer to the following Game 1 for a simple example.


<div style="text-align:center">
Game 1: Pure Cooperative Game
<table class="table_tab responsive">
    <tr>
        <td></td> 
        <td></td> 
        <td colspan="2">Player 2</td>   
   </tr>
   <tr>
        <td></td> 
        <td></td> 
        <td>Action 1</td> 
        <td>Action 2</td> 
   </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">Player 1</td>    
        <td >Action 1</td> 
        <td>1, 1</td> 
        <td>0, 0</td>  
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td >Action 2</td> 
        <td>0, 0</td> 
        <td>1, 1</td> 
    </tr>
</table>
</div>

* **Pure Competitive Games**, which is also called the **Common-payoff games**. In such games, each agent receives the same reward in the same outcome. Refer to the following Game 1 for a simple example.

<div style="text-align:center">
Game 1: Pure Cooperative Game
<table class="info">
    <tr>
        <td></td> 
        <td></td> 
        <td colspan="2">Player 2</td>   
   </tr>
   <tr>
        <td></td> 
        <td></td> 
        <td>Action 1</td> 
        <td>Action 2</td> 
   </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">Player 1</td>    
        <td >Action 1</td> 
        <td>1, 1</td> 
        <td>0, 0</td>  
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td >Action 2</td> 
        <td>0, 0</td> 
        <td>1, 1</td> 
    </tr>
</table>
</div>

# cooperate or coordinate

# incomplete information about state, share information

# agree to disagree

# More information may be harmful social value of information
