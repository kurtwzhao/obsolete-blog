> The reasons why animals, especially human beings, communicate are variant. According to my knowledge of economics and game theory, I give two reasons with some simple and pedagogical examples. Firstly, when cooperation is beneficial, agents use communication to coordinate their behaviors. Secondly, when the information about the environment or state is incomplete and different agents have different information, they communicate to exchange informations to get a better knowledge of the world.

# Preliminary
The following analysis and examples all depend on the framework of game theory.

## Cooperation and Competition
In general, games can be classified into three categories according to agents's disire of cooperation and competition:

* **Pure Cooperative Games**, which is also called the **Common-payoff games**. In such games, each agent receives the same reward in the same outcome. Refer to the following Game 1 for a simple example.

|        |Acrion 1|Action 2|
|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|Acrion 1| 1, 1 | 0, 0 |
|Action 2| 0, 0 | 1, 1 |

<div style="text-align:center">
Game 1: Pure Cooperative Game
<table>
    <tr>
        <td></td> 
        <td></td> 
        <td colspan="2">Player 2</td>   
   </tr>
   <tr>
        <td></td> 
        <td></td> 
        <td>Action 1</td> 
        <td>Action 2</td> 
   </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">Player 1</td>    
        <td >Action 1</td> 
        <td>1, 1</td> 
        <td>0, 0</td>  
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td >Action 2</td> 
        <td>0, 0</td> 
        <td>1, 1</td> 
    </tr>
</table>

* **Pure Competitive Games**, which is also called the **Common-payoff games**. In such games, each agent receives the same reward in the same outcome. Refer to the following Game 1 for a simple example.

# cooperate or coordinate

# incomplete information about state, share information

# agree to disagree

# More information may be harmful social value of information
