I'm a Ph.D. student majoring in economics at Pennsylvania State University. Recently I'm very interested in reinforcement learning especiall multi-agent reinforcement learning and this blog is used to record my learning notes. If you have questions or want to get in touch `wzz10@psu.edu`. I'm very happy to exchange ideas!
