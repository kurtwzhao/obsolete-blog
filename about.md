I'm a Ph.D. student majoring in economics at Pennsylvania State University, but recently I'm very interested in reinforcement learning especiall multi-agent RL and this blog is used to record my learning notes. If you have questions or want to get in touch 'wzz10@psu.edu'. I'm happy to exchange ideas with you!
